# Description #

My newest project I decided to start working on because I wanted to

understand better how automatic differentiation in frameworks like 'PyTorch' works. 

I am planning to turn it into a Machine Learning library in the future.

It currently includes a single C++ file to test some of the operator overloadings

for a variable class as well as to try different ways to store function gradients.

I might make this the part of my Linear Algebra library or at least provide some basic compatibility with it.
