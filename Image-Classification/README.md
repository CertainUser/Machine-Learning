Training and validation datasets were taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification.

Download the dataset, put it inside the project folder and rename it as 'intel_image_dataset'.

'interface.py' file provides basic GUI to showcase the quality of predictions of the model.

Follow along with the notebook file in this directory to create the model.
I am open to discover ways of how architecture of my model can be improved.

requirements.txt file contains libraries required to run the code files.
